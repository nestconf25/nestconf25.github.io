## **5th Neonatal Sleep Talks Symposium – Advancing Sleep Research & AI in Neonatal Care**

NEonatal Sleep Talks brings together scientists and healthcare professionals to share and exchange ideas on all aspects of sleep and the developing brain. The aim of the meeting is to provide an overview of **sleep in the newborn and early infancy**, from the basic science of sleep and the developing brain, to investigating the impact of sleep on health and wellbeing, particularly in high-risk infants. 

Recognizing the critical role of continuous brain monitoring in neonatal care, this year’s symposium will also include dedicated sessions on **AI-driven neonatal monitoring and brain health assessment**. These sessions will explore how machine-learning algorithms, EEG-based biomarkers, and data-driven approaches can support decision-making in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

This meeting aims to encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration between clinicians, neuroscientists, engineers, and industry partners to improve neonatal care through research, technology, and innovation.

###  Key Topics: Neonatal Sleep, NICU Monitoring & AI Innovations
* **Neonatal sleep and development:**
    * How sleep develops in utero and early infancy.
    * The importance of protecting sleep in the neonatal intensive care unit.
    * Issues affecting sleep in early infancy.
    * The development of circadian rhythms.
* **Technological advances in sleep and brain monitoring:**
    * Innovations in neonatal sleep assessment and analysis.
    * Challenges in sleep research and clinical translation.
    * AI-enabled monitoring tools for neonatal brain health.

**Who should attend?**  
Scientists (basic and applied), clinicians, and healthcare professionals with an interest in neonatal sleep, neurophysiology, and AI-driven neonatal monitoring. 

**Structure of the meeting**  
The meeting will consist of keynote speakers, invited talks and short submitted presentations from researchers as well as a poster session ([program details](https://nestconf25.github.io/program/)).
